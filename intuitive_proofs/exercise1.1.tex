\prob{1.1}{Read \emph{The Secret to Raising Smart Kids} By Carol Dweck and write a few pagagraphs about what you learned and how it may help you be successful in a proof-based math class.}

I really enjoyed this article. I believe that The Secret to Raising Smart Kids hit the nail right on the head. While reading, I was reminded of the satisfaction of improvement. When I look back at my proudest achievement, it took me two years to complete. I spent hours with little progress. Regardless, my understanding of the problem grew tremendously. In October, my friends and I participated in the University of Waterloo's senior math contest. Many of the concepts used were new to us. We spent hours every day preparing for the test. Even though I didn't do very well, it's still one of the biggest reasons I got interested in math. That month of preparation was the most productive I've been.

Currently, I'm on summer break. I plan to focus on understanding and improving my skills when I return. Specifically with Science, I hope to obsess over it. After I finish this chapter, I plan to order Ordinary Differential Equations by Morris Tenenbaum and Harry Pollard to help me learn physics and chemistry.

This isn't the first time I am reading this book. I've read through most of the book previously. However, I did not spend the time doing the problems. In my opinion, this was a huge mistake. I am currently reading the book again, this time working through the problems.
