\prob{1.2}{Explain the error in the following "proof" that 2 = 1.}

Let x = y. Then,

\begin{align}
  x^2        & = xy       \\
  x^2 - y^2  & = xy - y^2 \\
  (x+y)(x-y) & = y(x-y)   \\
  x + y      & = y        \\
  2y         & = y        \\
  2          & = 1        \\
\end{align}

\Ans On line 4, the proof divides by $x - y$, however since $x = y$ this step divides by $0$.
